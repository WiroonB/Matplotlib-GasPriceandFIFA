## Matplotlib - Real World Examples(Python)

Data analysis project using Matplotlib to visualize and explore real world datasets.

### Overview

This analysis completed using Matplotlib to visualize different graphs on two different datasets. 

First dataset is gas prices which has gas prices of different countries over time. 
  - Simple line graph shows gas prices over time in US dollars from three countries which are USA, Canada and South Korea. 

Second one is FIFA soccer players' information from different clubs in FIFA league.
Three different graphs are used to show different stats.
  - Histogram shows the distriutiin of player skills in FIFA in 20018.
  - Simple pie chart shows foot preference of FIFA players.
  - Exploding pie chart shows weight distribution of FIFA players in lbs.
  - Box and whisker chart shows professional soccer team comparison.
